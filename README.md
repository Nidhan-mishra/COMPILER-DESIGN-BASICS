*DESCRIPTION*: 
This project is a very simple compiler that is created in c++ the project contains three file's the lexer file , the parser file and the main file each contains the functions when called in the "main.cpp" file will combine together to compile a very simple arithmetic code give by the user in the code. the lexer and parser are the main two files in this the lexer implements a simple lexer (also known as a tokenizer) for arithmetic expressions in C++. The lexer reads a string representing an arithmetic expression and breaks it down into tokens. Each token represents a meaningful component of the expression, such as numbers or operators and the parser implements a parser for arithmetic expressions, building an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) from a sequence of tokens produced by a lexer. The parser processes the tokens according to the rules of arithmetic precedence (addition/subtraction has lower precedence than multiplication/division) then finally the main is designed to evaluate an arithmetic expression by using a lexer, a parser, and an Abstract Syntax Tree.The project was refferenced from online sources to implement this project is only for simple arithmetic expressions.
